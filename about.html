    <p>The whole world is talking about women's empowerment and has been for a while now. We decided to not talk about it and DO SOMETHING instead!</p>

    <p>Before we tell you what it is that we are doing, here's some interesting trivia for you - the average woman spends about 3500 days of her life menstruating. That translates to 10 years! 10 years of their lives that women spend in discomfort, pain, or moodiness.</p>

    <p>PMS and period cramps have been normalized. Brands are busy selling products to relieve women of the pain. Organizations evangelize paid leaves to their employees so they can rest on their "bad" days. PMS and period cramps are common. That doesn't mean they are normal. Nature doesn't design our bodies to be in pain or discomfort every month.</p>

    <p>At Inaari, we want to help build an equal world where women have pain-free periods and no longer have to deal with diseases that are related to hormonal imbalance. A world where women are aligned with their inner cycles and energy.</p>

    <p>We help menstruating women get rid of PMS symptoms & period cramps. We solve PCOS and other hormonal imbalances related to simple dietary and nutritional advice. And yes, weight loss for those who want it, as a happy side-effect.</p>

    <p>Women's hormone cycles are aligned to their menstrual cycle. Their nutritional needs, productivity at work, and how they feel about themselves and others are different during different times of the month. Through Menstrual Cycle Awareness, we help women combat not just issues related to hormonal imbalance (such as PMS, period cramps, weight gain, PCOS, PCOD, etc.) but also help them to optimize other aspects of their lives such as productivity, sleep, mood, libido, etc. and also help them feel supercharged and energized.</p>

    <p>The Inaari Mobile Application is driven by a woman's personal health data and aligned using our proprietary algorithms. It allows women to track the various phases of their menstrual cycle and provides them with personalized advice on what to eat, and when.</p>
